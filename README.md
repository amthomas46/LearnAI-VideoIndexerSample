# LearnAI-VideoIndexerSample
This repo contains some sample code for playing with the Video Indexer API.  

If you want to run this code, download the repository and add your account information to the Program.cs file. You'll also need to route to a .txt file on your local that contains the URLs to the .MP4 video(s) you'd like to analyze.
